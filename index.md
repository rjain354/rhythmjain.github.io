I am a second year Masters student researcher at [Georgia Tech Centre for Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/master-science-music-technology) in computational musicology, specializing in music emotion recognition and cross cultural music perception. I have also done extensive work in human subject studies, data analysis, music information retrieval (MIR), digital signal processing, Max/MSP/Jitter, and symbolic music analysis of Hindustani classical music. Throughout the program I have worked on numerous projects some of which are highlighted below.

Previously, I was a Bachelor’s student in BITS Pilani, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Shortly after I interned at various places including Amazon Development Centre, Goodera and worked as Software Engineer at Xilinx.

## My Research 
### Uncovering patterns in note-to-note transitions in Hindustani Classical Ragas
In this corpus-based analysis on Hindustani classical music ragas, we aimed to understand the relationships between different notes of a raga and ornamentation styles and the allocated time of day.The analysis was carried out on two symbolic datasets, the Saraga dataset as well as a Humdrum dataset using Python and Humdrum.

### A Cross-cultural Examination of Raga perception: Examining the link between Circadian Rhythms and Pitch Features
Designed a human perceptual experiment to understand the effect of time of day of listening on the perception of music based on time of Day theory (Prahar Theory) prevalent in Hindustani Classical music. Currently conducting preliminary analysis on participants' data.

## My Projects
### Sur Tarang
#### An interactive bio-feedback music system

Designed an interactive and generative music system enabling musicians to control several parameters of the accompanying instruments without the need to touch or manipulate physical interfaces. Sur Tarang translated body and mind signals (bio signals via EEG) as well as automatic gesture recognition into
the sounds of the accompanying instruments. The sound design was done in Ableton Live and the generative component used dynamic time warping to recognize gestures and mirror the ”Jugalbandi” style of performance prominent in Hindustani classical music.

MeloGraph is a visualization tool to aid musicians with their improvisation techniques. By extracting note-level pitch information from a given audio signal of a monophonic performance, this tool shows the relative note and transition prominence in the user’s performance. We used Harmonic Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) for onset detection, Normalized cross corelation function (NCCF) algorithms for F0 detection and NetworkX and Cytoscape libraries for visualization. For more details check out the [github](https://github.com/nol-alb/melograph_submission) repository.

### Software Synthesizer
Developed a python-based synthesizer that can be run using the command line. The codebase for the project can be found at the github repository link here. Taking symbolic music notation (Kern files) as input, the system produces synthesized output files in .wav format, downloaded to the user’s local machine. Synthesis of the signals was done using additive and wave table techniques.
