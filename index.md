I have also done extensive work in human subject studies, data analysis, music information retrieval (MIR), digital signal processing, Max/MSP/Jitter, and symbolic music analysis of Hindustani classical music.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rjain354/rhythmjain.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
